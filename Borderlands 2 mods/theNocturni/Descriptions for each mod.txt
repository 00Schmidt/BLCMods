1. Mods to mess around with(aka they may be unbalanced and/or broken)

 HH.txt- makes it so that Hellfire Halitosis is affected by melee damage
 kinda broken on Mania Hellborn, but Bloodlust Hellborn shouldnt be affected that much

 LtF.txt- increases the final explosion damage by twice, and the thrown dynamite by 3.6 times but its also changed to rocket splash instead of grenade splash. also increases the thrown dynamite's radius by a bit
 intended for non-explosive Kriegs who still want to have some fun, using this with an Explosive Krieg will most likely be broken/op
 
 2. Krieg Tweaks(fixes?)
 
 StV.txt- Silence the Voice's self damage is originally boosted by grenade damage, making it dangerous to swing your axe after activating Fuel the Blood
 this makes it so that the self damage is no longer boosted by grenade damage(or anything else as far as I know)
 
 FlameFlare.txt- adds a 9% Burn damage reduction(not Fire damage, mind you) to Flame Flare
 makes it so that burn DoTs from external sources such as enemies or barrels are less likely to kill you, since those DoTs are affected by the increased burn duration too
 
 Stacks.txt- Elemental Elation stacks and Salt the Wounds stacks shared a spot for being displayed, making it so that you could only see one of the two
 this makes it so that you can see both
