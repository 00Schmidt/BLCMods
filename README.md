# BLCMods

This is a repository for Community Mods made for the Borderlands series, specifically BL2 and BLTPS.

These mods should use the `set` command in the Unreal console to change in-game variables.
If your mod has specific considerations you should make it clear how to install.

## Contribution

If you are not part of BL2CP, to contribute a mod:
- `Fork` the repository (top right).
- `Commit` files to the respective folders. (either `Borderlands 2 mods` or `Pre Sequel Mods`)
- Send a `Pull Request` to `Compare` merge your fork to the `master` branch.

If you are part of [BL2CP](https://github.com/BL2CP) you do not need to fork or pull request.

## Installation

Installing these files follows the same process as for the BL2 Community Patch using the [Patcher](https://github.com/AnotherBugworm/Borderlands2Patcher)

Or, if you wish to keep your `.exe` unchanged and you are running Windows, you can use a [Cheat Engine Table](https://github.com/MagicGonads/Borderlands-Cheat-Tables).  
Go to `[Enable][Scripts]` and check `Disable Console Say` and `Unlock Set Utility`.
Every instruction that doesn't involve editing the `.exe` will still need to be followed.

For windows users `ExecLoader.bat` will automatically create an `Autorun` file which will execute multiple files at once for convenience.
The file must still be executed through the console but it will significantly reduce the number of manual commands.
