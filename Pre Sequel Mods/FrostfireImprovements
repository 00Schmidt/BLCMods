Changes:
Removed self-freeze mechanic.
Slight stat buffs.
Changed rarity colour to Legendary.
Increased price to reflect the new rarity colour.

Disclaimer:
I am still inexperienced with modding, though I was excited to be able to remove the self-freeze by myself and I wanted to share it.
If somebody with more knowledge can give the Frostfire SMG some of their attention and love, they could make it great and viable at level 70.
